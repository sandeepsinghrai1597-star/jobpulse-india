            Most job boards in India show listings and stop there. JobPulse India exists to fill the gap between
            discovery and employment — giving every candidate the tools they need to apply confidently, prepare
            thoroughly, and land roles that match their skills and goals.

          <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-slate-300">
            We focus specifically on the Indian job market: government exams, fresher roles, regional hiring, and
            the real career challenges that students from tier-2 and tier-3 cities face every day.
